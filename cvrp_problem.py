    Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)

    A fleet of vehicles with uniform capacity must service all customers with known demand.
    Vehicles start and end their routes at a common depot. Each customer is visited exactly once.

    Instance Data:
      - nb_customers: number of customers (excluding the depot)
      - truck_capacity: capacity per vehicle
      - dist_matrix: 2D distance matrix among customers (0-indexed)
      - dist_depot: distance from the depot to each customer (0-indexed)
      - demands: demand for each customer (0-indexed)

    Candidate Solution:
      A dictionary with key "customersSequences" mapping to a list of lists (one per vehicle).
      Each inner list is a permutation of customer indices (0-indexed) representing the route of that truck.
      Together, these lists form a partition of {0, ..., nb_customers - 1}.

    Objective:
      For each truck route:
         - Compute the route distance as:
             depot to first customer + sum of distances between consecutive customers +
             distance from last customer back to depot.
         - Ensure that the total demand on the route does not exceed truck_capacity.
      Also count the number of trucks used (i.e. routes with at least one customer).
      The overall objective is lexicographically minimizing:
         (number of trucks used, total distance traveled).
      (For instance, overall = trucks_used * M + total_distance, with M large.)
